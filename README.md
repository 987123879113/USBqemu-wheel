USBqemu-wheel
=============

PCSX2 usb plugin based on gigaherz et al. usb plugin.

Started as a way to use Logitech MOMO wheel with Gran Turismo 4.
As such, current version has some quirks with other games (aka doesn't really work).
Need to fix up the descriptors.

Use the VS 2010 project file. Linux version coming up.
